CobaltEssentials for BeamMP Servers

## Basic Owner Setup of CobaltEssentials

This guide will walk through the most basic process of installing **CobaltEssentials** onto a **BeamMP Server** and setting yourself as the **owner**.

This assumes you have successfully set up your own **BeamMP Server**, there is a guide **[here](https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/server-installation)**.

### Installation and setting yourself as owner:
1. Get the latest **CobaltEssentials** from the **[CobaltEssentials GitHub](https://github.com/prestonelam2003/CobaltEssentials)**

2. With the **BeamMP Server** ***NOT*** running:
    * Make sure **CobaltEssentials** is extracted correctly into the server **Resources** directory as: `â€¦/Resources/Server/CobaltEssentials`

3. **Launch** the server with CobaltEssentials installed.

4. In the server console, run the command `ce setgroup yourName owner`, replacing `yourName` with your BeamMP username.

You are now set with owner permissions.

## Features:

* Owner / Administrator / Moderator / Default interfaces based on groups!
* Manipulation of player permissions, vehicle and parts permissions, CE and base server configuration, sun control and sync, weather control and sync, simulation speed control and sync, gravity control and sync, custom temperature curve control and sync, teleportation control and timeout, nametag whitelisting and timer based nametag hiding, server-wide and per-vehicle remote start/stop and freeze/unfreeze.
* voteKick, Kick, Ban, TempBan, Mute, Whitelist
* Handy `Join Race` and `Race Countdown!` buttons to freeze all players in place, notify and countdown, and then release everyone for perfect race starts!
* And more, all via the interface!

## Pre-requisites:

1. BeamMP Server 3.1.0 (as of CEI v0.7)
2. [CobaltEssentials](https://github.com/prestonelam2003/CobaltEssentials) 1.7.2 or newer installed.
3. As owner, have yourself set as owner group in CobaltEssentials (i.e. `ce setgroup yourName owner` in server console)

## Installation:

1. Grab the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/StanleyDudek/CobaltEssentialsInterface/releases).
2. Unpack it somewhere.
3. Drag the folder `Resources` into the directory where your server is installed.
4. Start the server, and join.
5. The interface should be enabled by default. In the chat, enter the command /CEI to toggle the interface. You may set the default interface state in the Cobalt Essentials section of the interface's Config tab.

## Updating from pre-v0.7 to v0.7 and up:

1. Grab the latest release from [releases](https://github.com/StanleyDudek/CobaltEssentialsInterface/releases).
2. Unpack it somewhere.
3. Drag the folder `Resources` into the directory where your server is installed, accept the overwrites.
4. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED that you delete `environment.json`, `interface.json`, and `nametags.json` from the CobaltDB folder, YMMV if you do not.
